# Programming Techniques Projects
These are my assignments for the "Programming Techniques" laboratory.

**Assignment 1 - Polynomial Processing System** <br/>
This assignment consists of developing an application which receives as input two polynomials represented by two strings and has as output a string containing the result of an arithmetic operation between the first two polynomials or just the first one, thus the output is also a polynomial. The arithmetic operations that will be implemented are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation and integration. <br/>

**Assignment 2 - Queue Simulation - Queues and Multithreading** <br/>
This assignment consists of developing an application which simulates a grocery store environment. It is mandatory that the app receive as input the arrival interval of time of the customers, the service interval of time for each customer, the maximum time the simulation should run for and the number of queues, i.e. the number of open cash registers the store should have. <br/>
The application should simulate a series of clients arriving for service, entering queues, waiting, being served and finally leaving the queue. It tracks the time the customers spend waiting in queues and outputs the average waiting time. <br/>

**Assignment 3 - Order Processing / Warehouse Management** <br/>
This assignment consists of developing an application which simulates an online shop that uses relational databases are used to store the products, the clients and the orders. <br/>

**Assignment 4 - Bank Simulation** <br/>
The assignment consists of developing an application which simulates a bank. The bank must be able to provide its customers 2 types of accounts: Saving accounts and Spending accounts. The saving account allows a single large sum deposit and withdrawal and computes an interest during the deposit period. The spending account allows multiple deposits and withdrawals, but does not compute any interest. <br/>

**Assignment 5 - Activities Analysis - Lambda Expressions** <br/>
Consider the task of analyzing the behavior of a person recorded by a set of sensors. The historical log of the personâ€™s activity is stored as tuples (start_time, end_time, activity_label), where start_time and end_time represent the date and time when each activity has started and ended while the activity label represents the type of activity performed by the person <br/>
Thus, the most important objectives of this assignment would be learning what lambda expressions and streams are and how they work, extracting the data from the given text file and storing it. <br/>
